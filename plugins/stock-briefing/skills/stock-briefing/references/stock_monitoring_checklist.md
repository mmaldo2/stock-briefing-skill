| Pension settlement charges | ~$120-125M non-cash charges expected H2 FY26 |

**Ecosystem Signal:** Hyperscaler capex plans, data center construction starts, liquid cooling adoption rates. Vertiv (VRT) and Eaton (ETN) commentary on order books is a leading indicator. Also watch NVDA Blackwell power/thermal requirements — higher TDP = more cooling demand.

---

### LUMN — Lumen Technologies (Fiber & Network Infrastructure)

**Primary Thesis:** Legacy telco turnaround via AI-driven fiber/network infrastructure demand; PCF (Private Connectivity Fabric) and NaaS contracts.

| KPI | Why It Matters |
|-----|---------------|
| "Grow" revenue category (% of total, growth rate) | Now ~50% of North American enterprise; double-digit growth target |
| "Nurture" and "Harvest" legacy revenue decline rate | Speed of legacy erosion determines net revenue trajectory |

## Appendix: Earnings Season Workflow

### Pre-Earnings (1 Week Before)
1. Review consensus estimates (EPS, revenue, key segment metrics)
2. Check options-implied move for the stock
3. Re-read prior quarter's guidance vs. current consensus
4. Note key questions from last call's Q&A that need follow-up
5. Check for any pre-announcements, 8-K filings, or management presentations

### Earnings Day
1. Read the press release and earnings tables *before* the call
2. Note beat/miss magnitude on headline numbers
3. Check segment-level results against expectations
4. Listen to the earnings call live (or read transcript same day)
5. Pay special attention to guidance and forward commentary
6. Note stock's after-hours reaction and implied move vs. actual

### Post-Earnings (1-2 Days After)
1. Read full 10-Q (not just the press release) — focus on risk factors, AR/inventory, debt
2. Review sell-side notes for consensus takeaways
3. Update personal valuation model / tracking sheet
4. Reassess position sizing and thesis validity
5. Note any follow-up items for next quarter
